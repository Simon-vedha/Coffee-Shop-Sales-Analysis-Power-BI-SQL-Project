## ðŸ“š Project Overview

This project focuses on **Sales Analysis** using SQL queries on a dataset containing information about **Orders**, **Products**, and **Locations**.  
It includes tasks like data cleaning, view creation, aggregation queries, stored procedures, and detailed sales reporting based on different dimensions like product type, location, month, and day type (Weekdays/Weekends).

- **Orders**  
- **Products**  
- **Location**


## ðŸ“Š Key Tasks Performed

### 1. Retrieve Full Order Details
- Joined **Orders**, **Products**, and **Location** tables.

### 2. Create and Alter a View
- Created a view `OrderDetails` that includes a new calculated column `sales_amt` (`transaction_qty * unit_price`).

### 3. Sales Analysis by Location
- Total Orders
- Total Sales Amount
- Average Sales Amount
- Sales figures formatted as **$ Currency**.

### 4. Top 5 Most Sold Products
- Listed and ranked products based on the quantity sold.

### 5. 4th Top Sold Product
- Retrieved the 4th ranked product based on quantity sold.

### 6. Month-on-Month Sales
- Aggregated sales data month-wise.

### 7. Orders in Last 7 Days
- Two approaches to fetch recent orders:
  - Using `MAX(transaction_date)`
  - Using `CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL 7 DAY`

### 8. Sales for a Specific Product
- Sales performance of "Ethiopia Rg" across all store locations.

### 9. Orders with Higher Sales
- Retrieved orders where the `sales_amt` is greater than the average.

### 10. Products with Unit Price Less Than $5
- Two methods used:
  - Sub-query with `IN`
  - Sub-query with `EXISTS`
